<h2>Problem Description</h2>
<p>SuperBank is opening a new branch in Singapore. They are giving high interest rate to attract more people to deposit in SuperBank.

<ol>
<li>Create a new bank account with an initial balance.</li>
<li>Deposit money to his/her account.</li>
<li>Withdraw money from his/her account.</li>
</ol>

<p>The bank is giving an interest rate of <i>x</i>% per annum, and it is calculated on monthly basis as follows:
<div align="center"><p>interest = initial deposit &times; (<i>x</i>/12) &times; number of months elapsed</div>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a real number <i>x</i>, the interest rate (in %) per annum and an integer <i>p</i>, the period in months. It is followed by a sequence of operations (one operation each line), and terminated by “0”. The query format will be “Create <i>name x</i>”, “Deposit <i>name x</i>”, or “Withdraw <i>name x</i>”, where <i>name</i> is the name of the customer and <i>x</i> is the amount of money. There will be at most 100 bank accounts and they are all created on the first month when the bank is opening.

<h2>Output</h2>
