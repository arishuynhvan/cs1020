<h1>Swinging Monkey</h1>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this problem is to test the students' understanding on Stack.</p>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>
<p>Monkeys like to swing from tree to tree. They can swing from one tree to 
another directly as long as there is no tree in between that is taller  
than or have the same height as either one of the two trees. For example, 
if there are 5 trees with heights 19m, 17m, 20m, 20m and 20m lining up 
in that order, then the monkey will be able to swing from one tree to 
the other as shown below:<br>
1. from first tree to second tree<br>
2. from first tree to third tree<br>
3. from second tree to third tree<br>
4. from third tree to fourth tree<br>
5. from fourth tree to fifth tree<br>

<p>Tarzan, the king of jungle who is able to communicate with the monkeys, 
wants to test the monkeys to see if they know how to count the total number 
of pairs of trees that they can swing directly from one to the other. But 
he himself is not very good in counting. So he turns to you, the best Java
programmer in the country, to write a program for getting the correct
count for the trees in different parts of the jungle.

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains <b>N</b>, the number of trees in the path.
The next line contains <b>N</b> integers <br>
a<sub>1</sub> a<sub>2</sub> a<sub>3</sub> ... a<sub>n</sub> <br>
where a<sub>i</sub> represents the height of the ith tree in the path. <br>
0 < a<sub>i</sub> <= 2^31 <br>
2 <= <b>N</b> <= 500,000

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The total number of pairs of trees which the monkeys can swing directly
from one to the other with the given list of tree heights.

<h2>Sample Explanation</h2>
<pre>
Sample 1:
<ul><li>(3, 4): from 1<sup>st</sup> tree, it can only swing to the 2nd tree directly
           but not all the other tree as the 2<sup>nd</sup> tree blocks it.</li>
	<li>(4, 1) and (4, 2): from the 2<sup>nd</sup> tree, it can swing directly to the
           3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> tree directly.</li>
	<li>(1, 2): It can swing from the 3<sup>rd</sup> tree to the 4th tree.</li></ul>


Sample 2: 
<ul><li>(19, 17) and (19, 20): from 1<sup>st</sup> tree, it can swing directly to 2<sup>nd</sup>
          and 3<sup>rd</sup> tree but not the rest.</li>
	<li>(17, 20): from the 2<sup>nd</sup> tree, it can only swing to the 3<sup>rd</sup> tree but
          not the rest.</li>
	<li>(20, 20): from the 3<sup>rd</sup> tree, it can only swing to the 4<sup>th</sup> tree but
          not the 5<sup>th</sup>.</li>
	<li>(20, 20): from the 4<sup>th</sup> tree, it can swing to the 5<sup>th</sup> tree.</li></ul>

Sample 3:
<ul><li>(12, 21): from 1<sup>st</sup> tree, it can only swing to the 2<sup>nd</sup> tree but not
             the rest.</li>
	<li>(21, 21): from the 2<sup>nd</sup> tree, it can swing to the 3<sup>rd</sup> tree but not
             the 4<sup>th</sup>.</li>
	<li>(21, 12): obvious</li></ul>
</pre>

<h2>Note</h2>
<ul>
<li>The results should be in long long range.</li>
<li>An efficient program is required. You may try some given testcases to see 
  if your program is fast enough.</li>
<li>For example, if you check all the pairs to see if there is any tree
  in between them that will block the swing, it might be too slow to 
  pass some of the test cases.</li>
<li>You can improve the efficiency by using a stack.</li>
</ul>
