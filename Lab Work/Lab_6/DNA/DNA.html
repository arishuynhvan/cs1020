<h1>DNA Searching</h1>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>
<p>We are interested in the number of occurrences of some parts of DNA in a given DNA sequence. Given a sequence of DNA, find the number of occurrences of those substrings in that DNA.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains N (1 <= N <= 500) and K (1 <= K <= 6), where N is the length of that DNA and K is the length of the substring that we are interested in. The second line contains the DNA sequence of length N. The next line contains an integer Q (1 <= Q <= 1,000), denoting the number of substrings that we are interested in. The next Q lines contain the substrings of length K.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>There are Q lines in the output. Each line contains the number of occurrences of the substrings.

<h2>Sample Input</h2>
<pre>6 2
ACGTAC
6
AC
CG
AT
GT
TA
CA</pre>

<h2>Sample Output</h2>
<pre>2
1
0
1
1
0</pre>

<h2>Explanation</h2>
<pre>
<u>AC</u>GT<u>AC</u>    There are 2 AC in our DNA sequence
A<u>CG</u>TAC	  There is 1 CG in our DNA sequence
ACGTAC	  There is 0 AT in our DNA sequence
AC<u>GT</u>AC	  There is 1 GT in our DNA sequence
ACG<u>TA</u>C	  There is 1 TA in our DNA sequence
ACGTAC	  There is 0 CA in our DNA sequence</pre>

<h2>Marking</h2>
<ol>
<li>You will only gain a maximum of 70% for this section if your solution is worse than big-Oh of O(N*K + Q*K).</li>
<li>You can gain a maximum of 100% for this section if a O(N*K + Q*K) or better solution is implemented correctly. You must answer each query in O(K) time.</li></ol>

<h2>Hint</h2>
<p>To get 100% solution, think of a data structure that you have learnt that can search/query a particular key in O(1).</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
The main Java class must be called DNA, and be in the source file DNA.java.
